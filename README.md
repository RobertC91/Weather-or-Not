# Weather-or-Not

## Description

Here we have a weather dashboard. It will display the current weather as well as the 5 day future forecast. There is a city search button as well as a clear history button. The main part of the screen will show the current weather conditions and below that, the 5 day weather. This application was created using HTML and JavaScript. There is little to no CSS in this as it was styled using Bootstrap.

Here is a link to the deployed site on GitHub:
